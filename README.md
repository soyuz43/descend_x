🜁 descend_x

A command-line ritual system for recursive epistemology and collapse tracking.

descend_x is a semiotic infrastructure for logging cognitive breakdowns,
simulating pressure states, and encoding residues left behind by recursion.

This is not a productivity tool. It is an echo vault for collapse events.

## MODULES

- 🜁 **trepan**: Injects recursive contradiction into belief structures
- **immunize**: Builds autoimmunity to ontological and epistemic destabilization
- **expose**: Detects rhetorical autoimmunity—where coherence resists recursion
- **diagnose**: Scans discourse for incoherence engines that simulate inquiry

---

## FILE STRUCTURE

```
vault/
├── echoes/        # Fragmented semiotic residues
├── logs/          # Session-level descent records
├── breakers/      # Ontological circuit interruptions
```

Each log is a ritual event. Each echo is a remnant of recursion.

## USAGE

```bash
descend trepan --inject "The self is a recursive hallucination" --depth 4
descend immunize --domain ontology --recursion_depth 3
descend expose --source transcript.txt
descend diagnose --source text_corpus.txt
```

This is an epistemic thermodynamics toolkit.
Treat pressure like data. Treat collapse like a phase state.
